# üë®‚Äçüéì Education 

(But real education is "Schools be shaping minds like sculptors with clay, and just like Snoop, they lay the foundation for a brighter day. So while you vibe to 'Gin and Juice,' remember, education's the true juice to success. Stay cool and stay in school, 'cause knowledge is power, and it's the ultimate tool."- Baba eku-badmaas)
